**Background of PetCare App 1.0: Some Key Features of the app**

PetCare is a mobile application designed to streamline the process of scheduling pet care services for pet owners and veterinary doctors alike. The app was conceived as a project for the Mobile Development subject, a general tool for pet owners and vets to manage pet care appointments efficiently.

1. Convenience for Pet Owners:
PetCare aims to provide pet owners with the ultimate convenience in scheduling pet care services. Through the app's user-friendly interface, pet owners can easily access their accounts and send schedule requests for various services for their beloved pets. Whether it's a routine check-up, vaccination, grooming, or any other pet-related service, PetCare allows pet owners to book appointments at their preferred time and location.

3. Approval System for Vet Doctors:
To ensure a seamless process, PetCare incorporates a reservation approval system. Once a pet owner submits a schedule request, it is sent to the respective vet doctor for approval. This feature helps in maintaining the vet's schedule and avoiding any potential overbooking issues.

4. Cancellation Capability:
PetCare acknowledges the dynamic nature of pet owners' lives and the possibility of last-minute changes. Thus, it enables users to cancel scheduled appointments through the app. This cancellation feature helps vets in effectively managing their appointments and providing better care to their patients.

5. Memo Upload for Price Increase:
To facilitate transparency and communication, PetCare allows vet doctors to upload memos in case of any price increase in their services. This information is instantly displayed to all users, ensuring that pet owners are well-informed about any changes in pricing before making new reservations.

7. Uploading Medical Records/Certificate:
These records are accessible to the vet, enabling them to review the pet's medical history and ensure that the requested service is suitable and safe for the pet.
